- 👋 Hi, I’m @karsten-larsen
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about various programming languages, particularly front-end, but specifically JavaScript for its full-stack capability.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and its framework extensions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects, or projects that will allow me to dive into React, Angular, or Node.js environments. 
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to drop a message on my Git!
